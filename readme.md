 **RG-Backup**  
 Originally created as a backup of information about old mobile apps and games for platforms such as J2ME and Symbian, based on rugame.mobi data to preserve the information from that website, before it died. This project itself does not include any game files, but it provides a big collection of metadata and provides an option to add an external mirror to work with.  
    
 This branch represents a remake based on PetiteVue framework.
